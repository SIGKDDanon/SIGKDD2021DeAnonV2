# Requirements
# Running Simulations
In the folder PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_scripts we have provided shell scripts to run simulations. See the contained README.txt (PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_scripts/README.txt) for a description of each shell script. 
# Analyzing Simulations
After simulations have been run, they will be saved to the folder XX. You can then analyze these simulations using the python scripts in the folder XX. See the contained README.txt (XX) for a description of each file. Note that the analysis files assume you have saved run and saved XX.
