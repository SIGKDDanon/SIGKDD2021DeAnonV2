# Requirements
# Running Simulations
In the folder PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_scripts we have provided shell scripts to run simulations. See the contained README.txt (PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_scripts/README.txt) for a description of each shell script. 
# Analyzing Simulations
After simulations have been run, they will be saved to the folder PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_analysis_saves. You can then analyze these simulations using the python scripts in the folder /PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_analysis_scripts. See the contained README.txt (PostDiffMixture/simulations_folder/simulation_analysis_scripts/README.txt) for a description of each file. Note that the analysis files assume you have saved run and saved PostDiff TS for c in {XX}, Epsilon TS for epsilon in {XX}, PostDiff Greedy for c in {XX}, and Epsilon Greedy for c in {XX}. If you have not run these then you will need to modify the analysis code to remove reference to these saves.
